# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (TBD)

- Added the `caching/` module, containing caching helpers:
    - A wrapper supporting several cache stores: in-memory, disk, Redis, and Memcached
    - A decorator `@cached`, that caches a callable's return value based on its arguments
- Added the `debugging/` module:
    - A helper function `xp()`, to print debugging statements
    - A decorator `@profiled`, to collect and dumps profiling stats over a callable's execution
    - A helper `caller()`, allowing a developper to print debug information about a callable's caller
    - A helper `get_callable()`, extracting a callable instance from a frame
    - A helper `get_call_context()`, finding and returning the code context around a call made in a frame
    - A helper `get_frameinfo()`, which implements a faster `inspect.stack()[x]`
- Added the `formatting/` module, a collection of helper functions:
    - `oxford_join()` joins strings in a human-readable way
    - `transliterate()` represents unicode text in ASCII (using [Unidecode](https://github.com/avian2/unidecode))
    - `camelize()` transforms any case to CamelCase
    - `snakeize()` transforms any case to snake\_case
    - `kebabize()` tranforms any case to kebab-case
    - `parameterize()` formats a given string to be used in URLs
    - `ordinalize()` represents numbers in their ordinal representations
    - `adverbize()` represents numbers in their numeral adverb representations
    - `truncate()` truncates long sentences at a given limit and append a suffix if needed
    - `singularize()` returns the singular form of a given word
    - `pluralize()` returns the plural form of a given word
- Added the `iterating/` module, containing several helpers for iterables:
    - `renumerate()` enumerates an iterable starting from its end
    - `chunks()` splits an iterable into smalled chunks, padding them if requested
    - `partition()` splits an iterable into the items that validated the given predicate and the others
    - `uniq()` removes duplicates from an iterable while keeping the items' order
- Added the `i16g/` module, to help with locale management:
    - A helper class `Locale`, to dynamically load localization files from a package path
- Added the `importing/` module, a collection of helpers for dynamic importing:
    - `import_class_from_path()` fetches a class from a package path and returns it
    - `import_module_from_path()` exposes the contents of a module as globals from a package path
- Added the `logging/` module, containing drop-in configurations and custom handlers for the logging module:
    - `DEFAULT_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION` formats logs with debugging information and output to stderr
    - `DJANGO_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION` formats logs like Django's logger before routing to stderr
    - `FLASK_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION` formats logs like Flask's logger before routing to stderr
    - `PYRAMID_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION` formats logs like Pyramid's logger before routing to stderr
    - `RAILS_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION` formats logs in a Ruby on Rails' logger before routing to stderr
    - `AffixedStreamHandler` allows custom prefix/suffix to customize the way log records are emitted
    - `@muted` to silence all (or selected) loggers during a callable's execution
- Added `Singleton`, a metaclass useful to implement the Singleton design pattern
- Added `Borg`, a class useful to produce a singleton behaviour across multiple instances of a class
- Added `Sentinel`, a class that can be used to implement the Sentinel design pattern
- Added `@classproperty`, to combine @classmethod and @property
- Added `@deprecated`, to flag deprecated callables with a explicit message
- Added `@retryable`, to retry failing executing of a callable
- Added `@timed`, to measure the execution time of a callable
- Added `@sampled`, implementing 3 sampling strategies to filter calls made to a callable:
    - constant: Limits, or not, all calls received
    - probabilistic: Limits the number of calls to a ratio of accepted/refused calls
    - ratelimiting: Limits the number of calls to a fixed rate per second
- Added `@timeoutable`, stopping the execution of a callable if its run time is too long
